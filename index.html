                <p>I have always had a very strong interest in technology. Going back to the days of the early video game consoles, I found it fascinating how lines of computer code could translate into a sophisticated interactive experience. It was no surprise that I would eventually have a job in a tech-related field. I enjoy learning about and utilizing new technologies including IOT (Internet Of Things) and blockchain.</p>
                <p>My professional background is in telecommunications. I have worked in the industry for over 20 years, configuring and troubleshooting various voice and data services. I am currently a Post Sales Engineer at the second largest U.S. communications provider for global enterprise customers. My primary role is handling escalations for a strategic base of customers.</p>
                <p>In addition to facilitating a possible career change, I hope to use my web development skills to build and run a site covering blockchain projects.</p>
